According to the tutorials and everything else we've learned thus far in our wonderful class, it is, to the best of my knowledge, advantageous for us to know and use if statements to allow choice, and superb function to our programs. This is done by giving the user a fork, or catachism in the game and forving a decision to be made. Just as in life, once these choices have been made, you are now unable to go back 
and change to something else. You can give the user several different choices by using a combined else if option in your code. According to microsoft, the creator of C#, the following is true
"In an if-else statement, if condition evaluates to true, the then-statement runs. If condition is false, the else-statement runs. Because condition can’t be simultaneously true and false, the then-statement and the else-statement of an if-else statement can never both run. After the then-statement or the else-statement runs, control is transferred to the next statement after the if statement.
In an if statement that doesn’t include an else statement, if condition is true, the then-statement runs. If condition is false, control is transferred to the next statement after the if statement.
Both the then-statement and the else-statement can consist of a single statement or multiple statements that are enclosed in braces ({}). For a single statement, the braces are optional but recommended.
The statement or statements in the then-statement and the else-statement can be of any kind, including another if statement nested inside the original if statement. In nested if statements, each else clause belongs to the last if that doesn’t have a corresponding else. In the following example, Result1 appears if both m > 10 and n > 20 evaluate to true. If m > 10 is true but n > 20 is false, Result2 appears."
