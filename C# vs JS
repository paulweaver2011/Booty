Javascript is a useful, albeit unusual language, sloppily typed, and abusive to anyone sad enough to have to use it. it thinks itself very clever, but never really amounts to anything. 
C# is the breakfast of champions, and never does anything wrong, nor does it ever make mistakes. Everyone loves it and knows that when programming, everything, out of necessity, must 
be coded in C#. This is not my opinion, rather it is a fact of life so hard-coded into our DNA that everyone is inherently conscious of this and will therefore never use Javascript. 
Anyone attempting to use javascript will be categorized as degenerates, and will be subsequently "handled" per the Degenerate Act of 1958. Please advise your local Degenerate handler 
of anyone useing, or speaking ab out Javascript promptly so that the issue can be brought to a superior for processing.
